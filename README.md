# Road Lane Lines, Obstacles Detection Using Machine Learning
## About Project
In today’s world road safety is becoming a major concern since the number of vehicles used by people have been increasing at a dreadful rate and at the same time there are higher number of accidents caused due to many obstacles faced on roads. The proposed system detects the road lane lines as well as the obstacles such as potholes on the road using computer-based technologies. Here, a model is introduced through which it is possible to detect the lanes on straight roads and curved roads too using OpenCV. So, now potholes on roads can be detected mainly using the YOLOv4 technique which is used for real-time object detection. The whole process has been tested on real time videos for more accurate vision and compatibility.

## Getting Started
This is just an example of few instructions to be looked up on for setting up the project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3  

- OpenCV  

- NumPy  

- YOLOv4  

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:
 ```For pothole Detector  
pip install opencv-python
```
 ```For pothole Detector  
pip install numpy
```
```For pothole Detector  
pip install mattplotlib
```
```For pothole Detector  
pip install Flask
```
## Run Locally

To run the system, use the following command:

a) In PyCharm just simply right click & run “main.py” file for pothole detector.

b) In Prompt use the command –  
 ```For pothole Detector  
 python app.py 
```
c) Click directly on the command run for the execution of "main.py" in Lane line detection code.

## Usage
- pothole_on_road.mp4 is the video file for detection of potholes.
- Lane.mp4 is the video file for detection of road lane lines.
The system will open a window showing the
original video stream with the detected lane
lines and potholes highlighted in green and black respectively.

## Ultimate Result
For Road lane line detection :

Finally, road lane lines along with potholes are detected.
